<p>Born and raised in the Pacific Northwest, I was fortunate enough to grow up around the latest in new technologies. As a teenager I enrolled in a class on basic HTML to learn more about what was on the “other” side of the screen, but followed my interest in the practice of medicine to the University of Washington, where I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Cellular, Molecular, and Developmental Biology. To relieve the stress of medical school applications, I started studying JavaScript – which is when I knew that I needed to switch careers.</p>

<p>I enrolled in an intensive eight-week course on Full-Stack JavaScript Development at Code Fellows in Seattle. This class revolutionized my understanding and reinforced my knowledge that I am following my true passion. I learned how to build webservers using Node.js, Express.js, how to integrate MongoDB for data persistence, and how to use Angular.js to develop the front-end of a website.</p>
