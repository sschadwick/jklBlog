<p>Born and raised in the Pacific Northwest, I have grown up surrounded by the latest technology. As far back as first grade, I can remember being absolutely fascinated by computers and their power to tell a story (video games), and have spent as much time as I have been able to since. Although it took about 5 years, this interest in technology grew into the desire to develop and I enrolled in a class on basic HTML. At the University of Washington, I studied another passion of mine and received my degree in Cellular, Molecular and Developmental Biology. Although my plan was to study and practice medicine, I started studying JavaScript on a whim and have loved every line of it.</p>

<p>Armed with a drive to switch careers to follow my longtime passion of Software Development, I enrolled in an intensive eight-week Development Accelerator on Full-Stack JavaScript Development at Code Fellows. This class revolutionized my understanding of programming: I learned how to build webservers using Node.js/Express.js, integrate MongoDB for data persistence, and using Angular.js to develop the front-end.</p>
