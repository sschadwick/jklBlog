# D3.js Visualization of Obesity Prevalence data from IHME

This app uses D3.js to analyze worldwide obesity prevalence data provided by IHME. There are options for filtering the data by metric (overweight or obese), gender (male or female), and country (dynamically populated from countries in dataset). The data can be visualized with either a relative or absolute scale. The title of the graph is dynamically generated depending on the filtering conditions.

App deployment (takes ~1 minute to fully load): [ihme-obesity-prevalence.herokuapp.com/](https://ihme-obesity-prevalence.herokuapp.com/)
