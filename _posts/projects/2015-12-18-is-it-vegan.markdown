This project is a work in progress. Repo is available at [github.com/sschadwick/is-it-vegan](https://github.com/sschadwick/is-it-vegan).

All PR contributions are greatly appreciated!

Is It Vegan? is an app that helps consumers identify ingredients in common grocery store items by scanning the item barcode on a mobile phone.

Although the app was initially conceived to determine if an item was vegan or not, this app is easily extendible to scan for known allergies.
