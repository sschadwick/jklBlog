<p>I decided to build a blog, following inspiration from [Union.io](http://blog.union.io/code/). The nginx server is running on a Digital Ocean droplet, using Jekyll to serve static webpages along with the Start Bootstrap Clean Blog theme. This is a work in progress, and you can expect more features as development progresses.</p>

<ul>
  <li><s>Register a domain name</s></li>
  <li>Write a couple of interesting articles</li>
  <li>Update <s>background images</s>, fonts, and color theme</li>
  <li>Design a svg favicon</li>
  <li><s>Fix contact form</s></li>
  <li><s>Add HTTPS support</s></li>
</ul>
