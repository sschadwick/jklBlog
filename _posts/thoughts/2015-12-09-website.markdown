<p>I decided to build a blog, following inspiration from 
<a href="http://blog.union.io/code/">Union.io</a>. The nginx server is running on a Digital Ocean droplet, using Jekyll to serve static webpages along with the Start Bootstrap Clean Blog theme. This is a work in progress, and here are the things I've accomplished so far.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Created a blog using jekyll</li>
  <li>Built the contact form in PHP</li>
  <li>Rented a droplet on Digital Ocean</li>
  <li>Added my previous work</li>
  <li>Added and optimized TLS using Let's Encrypt</li>
  <li>Wrote a cron to update TLS certs bimonthly</li>
  <li>Added a favicon</li>
</ul>
